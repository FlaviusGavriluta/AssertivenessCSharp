# Experience map

## Assertive communications

Choose a situation in which you believe you have acted in an assertive manner!
Try to recall the feelings you have been through during and after the situation
concerned and try to imagine the feelings of the other person(s) involved as
well. Use this Experience Map to write a short account of these feelings as well
as their impact on you and your partner(s). Bear in mind that there are no right
or wrong answers! Feel encouraged to share your subjective experience in your
own voice! You may be positive or even critical about the concept and practices
of assertiveness. You may find it useful for your work to read/watch any of the
background materials recommended in the course curriculum.
